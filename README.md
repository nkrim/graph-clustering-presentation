# Graph Clustering Presentation

An example of graph clustering to solve route assignment for postal workers. Made in python and presented in the form of a collaborative Jupyter notebook. Presents two different approaches, first a more naive and efficient approach, and then a subsequent method that is far more robust and produces more consistent results.

To run the commands, first make a copy of the notebook to your own google drive. Then, go to the "Runtime" menu on the top toolbar and select "Run all". Once this is done, you can freely make changes to and run any of the intermediary steps. I would reccomend going to the bottom and running the random testsof the final method.
